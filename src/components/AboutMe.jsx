            <p className='font-light text-xl mt-5 '>Hello! I'm Rajneesh Rathore, a passionate B.Tech student with a growing interest in web development and modern technologies. I love building user-friendly interfaces and exploring the ever-evolving world of tech.

                I’m currently learning React, JavaScript, and other powerful tools to become a skilled developer. I’m driven by curiosity, and I enjoy solving problems and bringing ideas to life through code.

                When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring new tech trends, learning something new, or just enjoying a bit of music and creativity.

                I'm excited about the journey ahead and the opportunities to grow, build, and contribute to meaningful projects!</p>
